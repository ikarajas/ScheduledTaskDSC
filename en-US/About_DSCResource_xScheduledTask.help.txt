SHORT DESCRIPTION
	The RobotPlatoon Resource configures customised AWS Autoscaling groups in the Domain Robot Army
	
LONG DESCRIPTION
	Domain's Microservice architecture requires compact, performant, high-availability microclusters.
	These are provided by the Robot Army.
	Version 2.0 of the Robot Army is driven by PowerShell DSC 
	
ATTRIBUTES
	Ensure 					- "Present|Absent"
	Name  					- unique name for the cluster, usually prefixed with 's' for staging, 'p' for production, and so on
	OctopusProject 			- Project Name in Octopus Deploy
	OctopusRole 			- Role name in OctopusDeploy
	InstanceType 			- AWS Instance sizing - usually a t2.small for staging clusters, t2.medium of m3.medium for production
	VPC 					- AWS VPC into which this cluster will be provisioned. Can be 'Staging', 'Production' or 'UAT'. STaging and UAT are co-tenanted in the same AWS VPC at present
	HealthCheckEndpoint 	- ELB healthchecks need an endpoint to check. usually this is HTTP:80/ping, TCP:80, or HTTP:80/about 
	MinSize 				- Minimum Cluster Size
	MaxSize 				- Do I really have to tell you?
	AMI 					- Amazon Machine Image. Optional. If omitted, this defaults to the latest Windows 2012 R2 Core Edition AMI
	PublicInstances 		- allows provisioning of EC2 instances into the Public subnets, whereas ordinarily they would be private
